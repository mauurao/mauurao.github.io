This is due to the greater attention that gender issues receive by the younger generations, verifying a greater sensitivity and less tolerance towards situations of discrimination and prejudice. This year, in fact, numerous situations occurred in Portugal and throughout the world, all highlighted in prime time, with great expansion in social networks such as the “Black Lives Matter” movement, stimulating the Portuguese to feel more informed, mainly to searches such as “sos racism”, “xenophobia”, “contra racismo”, “racism what is it” and “racism definition” being quite positive, showing a great awareness and progression in the topic.

In conclusion, in this Google Trends measure of interest, <b>I note that racism has much more impact at the level of searches in Portugal when it is linked to football news</b>, leaving in question if our increasingly technological society is aware of this reality and if it assumes the evident existence of interpersonal, institutional and structural racism and the need to draw concrete public policies to fight it.
