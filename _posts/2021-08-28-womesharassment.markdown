<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In partnership with the Marketing technician Beatriz Monteiro, an article was carried out regarding a survey with the objective of analyzing the occurrence of harassment of women in the streets and their reaction. We can approach the subject from a physical or psychological point of view, and they result in problems of the same nature.

<div style="text-align: justify">
The analysis of the answers to this questionnaire will serve as reflection, and awareness in order to contribute to the reduction of these occurrences.

The questionnaire was submitted through question boxes and open response on the instagram platform, in which the data collected were processed and visualized through Microsoft Excel and Power BI programs. <br><br>

<strong>Keywords:</strong> Analysis, harassment, reflection, awareness

<div style="text-align: justify">
In total <strong>428 responses</strong> were collected from women, in which 61.45% is between the age of 18 to 30 years.

<div style="text-align: justify">
It was visualized that <strong>73.83% of these women have already been subject to situations of harassment in the street.</strong>

<blockquote>
<q> <strong>I felt so uncomfortable that I started taking another street, to avoid that feeling</strong> — Daniela M.</q>
</blockquote>

&ensp;

<div style="text-align: justify">
The data exposes that most of the women surveyed faced with these situations, <strong>choose to ignore</strong>, thus it can be deduced that women are relatively accustomed, perhaps conformed, standardizing the situation unconsciously.

<div style="text-align: justify">
As a reflection and with some research, it has been realized that this problem is somewhat ingrained in women, and there is an educational lag in approaching and reporting it.
<br><br>
<strong>There are numerous helplines, why is it that women do not feel supported?</strong>
<br><br>
From the various open accounts received, incorporated throughout the article, one notes the <strong>“traumas”</strong> in the words and an <strong>uneasy mental state in addressing these memories.</strong>
</div>

<blockquote>
<q> <strong>Honestly? I feel bad…I feel like I’m not protected.<br> 
Then my friends (men) say that if I answer I’m giving them importance.</strong> — Ruth P.</q>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: justify">
The respondents were intentionally asked how they would identify with three expressions, however atypical they may be, regarding the justification of this type of behavior, heard by relatives, friends or the surrounding environment. These were: “This is normal”, “It’s in men’s nature”, “It’s because you’re beautiful”.
</div>

</p>

<div style="text-align: justify">
It is perceived that most ignore or normalize the situation. <br>
Thus leaving the question, <strong>“Why?”.</strong>
</div>

<blockquote>
<q> <strong>Lately I really feel disgusted, I feel too objectified and victimized by something that society considers to be man’s nature and normalizes it</strong> — Joana L.</q>
</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: justify">
Therefore, we ask ourselves, <strong>is it because of fear?</strong> 

<br><br>

<strong>Women are constantly modifying their behavior in an attempt to avoid being objectified or attacked, reporting serious concerns about their personal safety whether during the day or night.</strong>

<br><br>

Harassment is not a crime in Portugal and elsewhere in the world, however, it is possible to criminalize it through other criminal frames, for example, through the crime of stalking or offense to physical and moral integrity. Victims of harassment end up being ashamed and do not disclose these situations, imprisoning themselves in their psychological fragility, thus not advancing legally. 

<br><br>

We therefore conclude that not enough has yet been done by the entities responsible for decision making, thus requiring a more assertive public, educational and systematic reform. 

<br><br>

**Stay Safe!**
