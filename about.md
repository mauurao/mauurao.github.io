**Hey, I'm Mauro**. <br>
**This site has the purpose of showing a little bit of how I have fun and get involved with my profession.**

&ensp;

Results-oriented, multidisciplinary data professional and enthusiast with more than 3 years of experience developed in medium and large Information Technology companies. 

MSc in Integrated Decision Support Systems (Business Intelligence Systems) from ISCTE - Instituto Universitário de Lisboa and with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrotechnical Engineering from Politécnico de Setúbal.

Currently, acting as Business Intelligence Analyst.

&ensp;

In my free time, I enjoy reading, programming, playing on my Xbox 😜 🤓  <br>
... and sleep (I badly need.. ahah).

&ensp;


And let me tell you something to motivate you: 🙏🏽

**99% of your problems can be solved by switching:**

- excuses for ownership <br>
- toxic people with mentors <br>
- junk food for nutritious food <br>
- bad habits with positive habits <br>
- cable news with reading & walks <br>
- perfectionism with embracing failure <br>


&ensp;

**Thank you!**
