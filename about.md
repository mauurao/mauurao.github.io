**Hey, I'm Mauro**.

Results-oriented, multidisciplinary data professional and enthusiast with more than 3 years of experience developed in medium and large Information Technology companies. 

MSc in Integrated Decision Support Systems (Business Intelligence Systems) from ISCTE - Instituto Universitário de Lisboa and with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrotechnical Engineering from Politécnico de Setúbal.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, programming, playing on my Xbox 😜 🤓 and sleep (I badly need.. ahah).

And let me tell you something to motivate you: 🙏🏽

**99% of your problems can be solved by switching:**

-excuses for ownership
-toxic people with mentors 
-junk food for nutritious food
-bad habits with positive habits
-cable news with reading & walks
-perfectionism with embracing failure
