And let me tell you something to motivate you: 🙏🏽

**99% of your problems can be solved by switching:**

- excuses for ownership <br>
- toxic people with mentors <br>
- junk food for nutritious food <br>
- bad habits with positive habits <br>
- cable news with reading & walks <br>
- perfectionism with embracing failure <br>
